    Issues With Generator Exhausting Concept
    ========================================
    Calling the Generator the second time wont give anything. Because 
    the Generator Object is already exhausted and has to be re-initialized.
    For Example-

        #   Calling the generator again wont work.
            
            for i in generator_object:
                print(i) # returns nothing
        
    If you call next() over this iterator, a 'StopIteration' error 
    is raised.
    For Example-
    
        #   calling with next()
            
            next(generator_object)
            
    Approaches To Solve The Issue
    ==============================
    To overcome Generators exhausted issue three approaches can be followed
    which are the following-
    
    1)  Approach 1: Replenish the Generator by recreating it again and iterate over. 
        You just saw how to do this.
        For Example-
                def simple_generator():
                    x = 1
                    yield x
                generator_obj1 = simple_generator()
                generator_obj2 = simple_generator()
                generator_obj3 = simple_generator()
        
    2)  Approach 2: Iterate by calling the function that created the generator in 
        the first place.
        For Example-
                
            for i in simple_generator(): # 'simple_generator()' is the Generator
                print(i)
                
    3)  Approach 3 (best): Convert it to an class that implements a __iter__() method. 
        This creates an iterator every time, so you donâ€™t have to worry about the 
        Generator getting exhausted.
