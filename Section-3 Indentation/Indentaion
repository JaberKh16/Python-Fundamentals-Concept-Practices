Python is more sensitive about indentation.
Indentation means a tabsize gap after the condition and looping branches
and function , class etc
Generally, Python by Default tabsize(\t) is 8
But in IDE it shows like C/C++/Java By Default tabsize (\t) is 4

e.g ----------------------->

       for str.islower() == True
            if True ==True
                print("Something")
